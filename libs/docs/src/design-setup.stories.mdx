Open a terminal on your local machine and type the following, then paste the copied url.
```bash
git clone <your copied url>
cd ui-components
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GovAlta/ui-components.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout upstream/alpha && git checkout -b docs
```

### Environment setup

Within the terminal in the newly created `ui-components` folder, run the following to install all project dependencies.
```bash
npm ci
```

To ensure that the latest changes are visible in Storybook, compile the web components with the following.
```bash
npm run run:web-components-dev
```

In a new terminal window of the project path, start the local docs storybook with the following:
```bash
npx nx run docs:storybook
```

**Or** to start storybook you can also use the NX tools by clicking on the play-like icon adjacent to the docs/storybook item.

### Submitting document changes

Once changes have been made and finalized you must create a commit for these changes. You can do so by clicking on the icons in the side bar with a badge number, that indicates the number of files changed. This will then show a list of the changed files and, at the top of the sidebar, provide a text box that allows you to enter a description of the changes. Once a description has been entered press `ctrl-enter` for linux/windows or `cmd-enter` on a mac to commit the changes.
