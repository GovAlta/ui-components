### Component

# Checkbox

Checkboxes are contained in a fieldset for accessibility and categorization purposes.
The option group (checkbox and label) can be selected by the user with an input device.
The option is meant to be submitted as data and is part of a form.
The input data, while can be selected, will not be recorded until the user presses a submission button.

## States

Checkboxes can be checked, unchecked, or indeterminate.
They have default, focus, hover, disabled and error states.

When a checkbox isn’t checked nor it is checked. It’s Indeterminate.
It’s that in-between state that we might consider a “Mix” between “Selected” and “Unselected” options.

## Spacing & Padding

Ensure there is 8px padding between checkbox and label.

<Note type="dont">
  <p> Change spacing and padding values </p>

</Note>

The padding between checkboxes is enough for any touch input device.

## Usage

Use checkboxes when the user can select more than one option.

The fieldset width is responsive to 100% of the layout container while the arrangement is set vertically for ease of scanning and comparing.
The fieldset title should be clear, concise, and relevant to the group of options.

Add ‘Optional’ only to questions which can be left unanswered.
Start all checkboxes with a capital letter.
Don’t include punctuations after checkbox label.
