# Contributors

<Note type="caution">
  This is for developers creating UI components for the ABGov ui-components
  library.
</Note>

### Required programs

You will need the following programs to make changes to the docs:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Recommended VSCode extensions

This project recommends the following extensions, but these are not necessary in anyway:

- Nx Console -> Performs builds and starts storybook
- MDX -> Add highlighting to storybook files
- Github -> Simplifies creating pull requests to merge changes
- Paste Image -> Allows for easy pasting of copy buffered into the .mdx files

### Fork it

Fork the ui-component library to your own repository, once that is setup on your local machine add the GoA repo as a remote.

```bash
git clone <your copied url>
cd ui-components
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GovAlta/ui-components.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout upstream/alpha
```

All PR branches will be created from your repo and and merged into the upstream repo via pull requests. To keep up to date perform fetch and merges from the upstream repo.

### Node Version

Ensure you are running the following version of node.

```bash
node --version  # 14.16.1
```

If you are not it is recommended to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to ensure that this is the version you are using. Once installed the `.nvmrc` will ensure that you are using the correct version.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
cd libs/web-components
npm ci
```
