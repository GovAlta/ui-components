# Development Setup

### Node Version

Ensure you are running the following version of node.

```bash
node --version  # 14.16.1
```

If you are not it is recommended to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to ensure that this is the version you are using. Once installed the `.nvmrc` will ensure that you are using the correct version.


Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Start the web component file watcher to automatically build the web components when changes are made:


### Playground

Provides live reloading for quicker development.

```bash
# script: run:web-components-demo
npm run --prefix libs/web-components demo
```

### Storybook

```bash
# script: run:web-components-dev
npm run --prefix libs/web-components dev
```

#### Start Storybook
