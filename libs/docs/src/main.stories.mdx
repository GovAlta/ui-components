# DDI Design system Overview

## Styles and Design tokens

Design tokens put design decisions like colour and font choices in one place so designers and developers are all using the same ones.
[Learn more about design tokens](https://goa-dio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/2261745761/Design+Tokens)

You can get our design tokens [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abgov/design-tokens)

## Components

Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.
You can use individual components in many different patterns and contexts. Our components are available in angular, react, and as web components.
