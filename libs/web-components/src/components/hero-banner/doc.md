# Hero Banner Library

When a page requires promotion or is featured, a photograph may be inserted into the page header as a hero banner for aesthetic appeal.


Use it like this:
```html
<goa-hero-banner
  heading="Hero Banner"
>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
</goa-hero-banner>
```
