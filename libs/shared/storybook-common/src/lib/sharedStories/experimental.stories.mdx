# About experimental
The experimental components are intended to provide a low friction way for teams to
contribute new components into the UI component libraries. Experiemental components
are added in a self-serve manner with minimal verification by a central team.

For consumers of the libraries, experimental components are used at risk.
Experimental component functionality is not verified and the component may or may not
be ultimately adopted into the library.

## Contribution process
Contribution process for experimental components is a largely self-service process,
and success depends on the contributor following the spirit as well as the letter
of the guidelines.

### General guidelines
- Keep the changes contained to specific directories.
- Do **not**  introduce scss variables, mixins, etc. unless they are officially part of
the Alberta or DIO Design Systems.
- Do **not** introduce new dependencies for experimental components. The UI component
libraries should generally be agnostic of any third party component library.
- Experiemental components may require peer dependencies, but they **must**  be listed
in the documentation.
- Comprehensive unit testing is encouraged but not required.
- A basic Story for documentation is required.
  - Include a **Contributor:** value in the documentation so consumers know who to reach
  out to for details.
  - Include a checklist of **TODOs** towards full incorporation of the component.
  Start with the following and add any other known gaps:
    - [ ] Design in design system XD and referenced by Story.
    - [ ] Component available in Angular, React, and Vue libraries.

### Procedure

1. Create a fork of the repository
2. Add your component under src/experimental of the appropriate library
3. Export your component within the experimental module
4. Create a merge request to have it published into the next tag of the library
