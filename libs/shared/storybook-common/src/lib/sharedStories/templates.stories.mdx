## Landing page

### Overview

A landing page template is designed to be the starting navigation point for users.
The page promotes important or relevant content and links.

<Preview withSource="none">
  <img src={templatesLandingPage} />
</Preview>

### Guidelines

_Page contents_
The landing page uses a wide layout format. The title banner may use a hero banner
while the page contents may employ up to three columns. The structure provides an
opportunity for wayfinding and promotion of content. A hero banner, callout banners,
call to action links, cards, icons, and imagery may be used. The arrangement and use
of content should be driven by findings through usability testing and user analytics.

<DoDont
  dos={
    'Use a hero banner in an appropriate and relevant setting. ' +
    'Ensure that the use follows accessibility standards.'
  }
  donts={'Promote links that are not frequently accessed or relevant to users.'}
/>

## Narrow

### Overview

A narrow column template prioritizes content. The narrow format aids readability by
maximizing distraction-free white space.

### Guidelines

_Contents_
In a narrow column template, the title banner, lede, and table of contents precedes
the narrow format content. The narrow column contains text headers and paragraphs.
If images are included into the narrow layout, they may be floated with the text, or
set to the width of the container. Two-column cards may also be used. The narrow format
makes use of white space, in order to make reading more comfortable, which is set to
the recommended maximum of 90 characters per line.

  dos={'Incorporate the table of contents if there are at least two headings.'}
  donts={'Use excessive promotional material in a narrow column template.'}
